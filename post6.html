            <p>Two of my Anthropology classes at the University of Victoria taught by Katherine Cook got the opportunity 
               to put on a pop-up exhibit at the Royal BC Museum on November 25th, 2017. The pop-up exhibit was called, 
               "Bridging Victoria: Stories from the Archaeological Past."</p>  
            <p>The exhibit was about 3 archaeological sites in Victoria: the Songhees Village, the Department of National 
               Defence Harbour Dredging in Esquimalt Harbour, and the Johnson Street Bridge.</p>
            <p>I created two projects for the event, one for each class. The participating classes were, Anth 485: 
               Digital Archaeology and Anth 392: Storytelling in Archaeology.</p>
            <p>For my Digital Archaeology class, I and 5 other students created an interactive map displaying the three 
               sites. Below is a video I took of it being used at the exhibit.</p> 
            <iframe width="750" height="600"

            </iframe>
            <span class="caption text-muted">Our Interactive Map</span>
            <br>  
            <p>Here's an image of it:</p>
            <a href="img/IMG_3844.jpeg">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/IMG_3844.jpeg" alt="">
            </a>
            <br>
            <p>We made it interactive using a kit called "Makey Makey," which is a circuit board that connects to your 
               computer. By holding the star (aka "Earth") on the board and tapping on another piece of tape across the board 
               (site description or sound effects), you complete a circuit and audio plays! Here's a link if you would like to 
               learn more about Makey Makey and how it works: <a href="https://makeymakey.com/">https://makeymakey.com/</a>.
            <p>We also had objects 3D printed and placed on the board to add to the interactivity and represent some of the 
               artifacts found at particular sites, and a swing bridge to represent the Johnson Street Bridge.</p>
            <p>For my Storytelling in Archaeology class, I created two audio tracks about the shoes found at the Johnson 
               Street Bridge Site and the Songhess Village/Shutters Site.</p>
            <p>During the day of, several shoes from the Johnson Street Bridge site were placed in a plinth with a panel 
               telling people to scan the QR codes to reach my audio tracks.</p>
            <p>While listening to my audio tracks view the following images, the Johnson Street Bridge Site shoes were placed 
               in a plinth on the day of the event:</p>

               I discuss what the shoes you wear say about your personality.</p>
            <p>In my second track,
               <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-842052864-784784360/underfoot-in-victoria">Underfoot in Victoria</a>, 
               I discuss where these particular shoes were found in their individual sites.</p>
            <p>During the day of the event itself I was the Event Photographer, to view images from the event click 
               <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1L2E6oK24NUtPgiBvpwJVE_xOkC3Fb5ca">here</a>.
            <p>We were also featured on CHEK news, click <a href="https://www.cheknews.ca/artifacts-uncovered-johnson-st-bridge-construction-site-391330/">here</a> to see that video and article, which also 
               displays my plinth of shoes.</p>
            <p>Participating in this exhibit was a wonderful experience and I'd love to do something like this again!!</p> 


              
            <!-- <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>
            <p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>
            <p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>
            <p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>
            <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>

            <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

            <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

            <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>
            <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
