            <p>In my Anth 392 (Storytelling in Archaeology) class, we have this one set of assignments called the 
               “Create Assignments.” One of our options for this assignment was to write ten pieces in multiple styles 
               of writing. In this post, I want to share some of things I wrote. Mostly I want to share the poems I wrote 
               because they’re what I’m most proud of. Most of these I wrote based on prompts given to us in the assignment, 
               but not all of them!</p>
            <p>This first poem I wrote, called “Uncovered” is written from the perspective of an archaeological artefact. 
               I had loads of fun writing it, as I do with any sort of poetic writing. Hope you like it!</p>
            <a href="img/IMG_3587.jpg">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/IMG_3587.jpg" alt="">
            </a>
            <p>This next poem I wrote is definitely my favourite. It’s a poem about an important archaeological tool 
              (the trowel) formatted to be trowel-shaped. I had the most fun with this poem and especially enjoyed the 
              process of making it all fit into the right shape. This is the piece I made that wasn’t based off a prompt!</p>

              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Screen Shot 2017-10-26 at 15.46.16.png" alt="">
            </a>
            <p>Another prompt we were given was to tell a story of a heritage site in Victoria, BC. I chose to do this in 
              poem form too, telling the story of Chinatown, the oldest Chinatown in Canada. How cool is that! For this one 
              I had to do a little bit of research on the history of Chinatown. Here’s my poem:</p>
            <a href="img/Screen Shot 2017-10-26 at 15.50.27.png">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Screen Shot 2017-10-26 at 15.50.27.png" alt="">
            </a>
            <p>Now, this piece of writing isn’t a poem. I created a Podcast script for the prompt “retell a recent news 
              article.” Here it is. Maybe I’ll record it sometime??</p>
            <a href="img/IMG_3590 (1).jpg">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/IMG_3590 (1).jpg" alt="">
            </a>
            <p>This final poem I also wrote for the prompt “retell a recent news article.” I thought it would be fun and 
              innovative to tell certain archaeological news in poem format. So, I did.</p>

            </a>
            <p>Hope you liked these five written pieces I made for my Archaeology class! I definitely had fun writing them 
              and wanted to share them with you. Which one is your favourite? Let me know in the comments below!</p>
          



              
            <!-- <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>
            <p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>
            <p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>
            <p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>
            <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>
            <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>
            <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>
            <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

            <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>
            <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
