        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto">
            <p>I used a template for designing the basics of my website and then inputed my own words/photos. In particular I 
              changed the layout of the "Contact" page. I changed the "Contact" page to "Social Media" because I'm not 
              personally too keen on putting my email up for everyone to see. Maybe I'll change my mind later though and put 
              it up. We'll see. I also added a comment function with the help of the internet! I like the idea of my followers 
              being able to communicate with me if they wish to!</p>
            <p>Nothing really went wrong. Nothing big at least. I had some issues with the images, because they automatically 
              resize themselves to fit in the space set aside for them. Unfortunately, that's just how the template is set up,  
              so I dealt with it. For some pages, I had to choose a different image than I wanted so that it would fit well and 
              look good. Additionally, the images get cropped differently whether you're on a smartphone or a computer. I 
              chose to set them up to look best when viewing on a computer. However, if I learn more CSS and figure 
              out how to edit the template effectively, then maybe I could change how the photos are sized and fix up the 
              difference between computer and smartphone viewing. That could take awhile, so for now things are fine as is.</p>
            <p>My website is successful because I organized the layout so that it is easy to follow and so that it looks 
              professional. Also, I feel as though I have made massive progress at grasping the coding language HTML through 
              making this website. I know a lot now about how HTML works through studying the code for the original text 
              from the template.</p>
            <p>I have had so much fun making this website. :) If you'd like, please comment with any 
              suggestions on how you think I can make it even better!! All ideas are welcome!</p>
              
            <!-- <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>
            <p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>
            <p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>
            <p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>
            <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>
            <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>
            <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

            <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>
            <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
