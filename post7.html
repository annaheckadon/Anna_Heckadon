            <p>Before you read on, go check out my Twine game here: New Shoes! This post is a reflection on the making of the 
               game. (Also PLEASE NOTE that this game is only about women’s shoes.)</p> 
            <p>Wow I didn't have much time to do this project! I feel like I could have made it a lot more expansive had I had 
               more time (more shoes, more stores). And also maybe I could have made it more aesthetically pleasing? Like I 
               pretty much stuck to the standard Twine format and didn't do much in the way of formatting the pages 
               differently or changing colours. Maybe I could have made the backgrounds as images of shoe stores? That could 
               have been cool and given it more of a realistic feel of shoe shopping.</p>
            <p>Overall I’m actually incredibly pleased with how it turned out! I quite enjoy playing my “New Shoes!” game and 
               I hope others do to! My starting point was really just to branch off from my “Shoes & Personality” audio track 
               about how certain types of shoes say certain things about who you are. From the information I gathered online I 
               had five points to start. They were,</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>ankle booties = aggressive girl</li>
              <li>practical shoes (sneakers) = agreeable</li>
              <li>extremely uncomfortable shoes (heels) = exceptionally calm</li>
              <li>shabby/less expensive shoes (particularly sandals) = liberal</li>
              <li>Well-kept shoes = attachment anxiety</li>
            </ol>
            
	          <p>There wasn’t much that I could do with number 5 because I made the game about buying new shoes. Obviously new 
               shoes are going to be well-kept, but this point is about what you do with them later on. Are you meticulous 
               about keeping them clean? Or do you not care so much? So, I decided not to include that point and rather just 
               the other four.</p>
	          <p>For point number 4, technically any shabby/less expensive shoes could indicate a liberal person, but I decided 
               to go with sandals because of one thing the article I read said: “sandal loving hippie” (insert link). Of 
               course I went with an image of a Birkenstock style shoe because those sandals are definitely the stereotypical 
               liberal persons shoe.</p>
	          <p>For choosing stores, I just picked stores I know and that are located in Victoria. Originally my shoe store 
               list was longer, but making a Twine game gets a little complex behind the scenes so I just decided to keep it 
               to two, with two pairs of shoes each. This would most simply showcase my four points about shoes and 
               personality.</p>
	          <p>I placed each shoe type in each particular store carefully. I looked the each stores’ website to find shoes 
               and that’s how I came to the decision for which shoes went where. You are more likely to find nice fancy heels 
               (point 3) and ankle booties (1) at Aldo’s, so I placed those shoes in that store in my game. You are also 
               definitely more likely to find some practical sneakers (2) and some cheap sandals (4) at Payless Shoe Source.</p> 
	          <p>Before deciding to make the game about buying new shoes, I was at a loss for how to turn my audio track into 
               a game. I created this Base Game to literally just showcase the points as simply as possible. I showed it to 
               my friends and they liked the idea, but some thought it was a little too sassy. I knew I had to fix that and 
               expand on it because that version was way too short of a game (and maybe a little too sassy). So somehow, it 
               just came to my head that I should make it about buying new shoes.</p>
	          <p>In the game you have the option of being told what the shoes say about you. You can either get told before you 
               buy them, after, or you don’t ever have to be told what they say about you if you don’t want to. It’s 
               completely up to the player. When you get told what the shoes say about you before you buy them, you have the 
               option of completing the purchase or putting them back and selecting other shoes. When you get told afterwards, 
               you have the option of keeping them or returning them.</p>
	          <p>Ultimately any option you select will lead you to buying new shoes again. If you buy/keep them, the next slide 
               is about how they’ve worn out and it’s time to buy new shoes. If you return them you get the option of trying 
               on new shoes in the same store or going elsewhere. Either way, the game goes on in circles, just like the 
               realistic course of buying shoes. (Except, of course, in real life you don’t get told what your shoes say 
               about you unless you look that up yourself!)</p>
	          <p>During the making process of the game it got a little bit messy when I was trying to make sure that all the 
               arrows went to the correct passages. I was also trying to create more generalized passages so that multiple 
               different shoes/stores could go to one passage, so that I wouldn’t have to keep re-making similar ones. I 
               figured that would be easier in terms of the layout of the behind the scenes aspect of my Twine game.</p>
	          <p>I got the shoe photos from a free image website called Pexels. All images on Pexels are licensed under the 
               Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license. As stated in the game itself (in the Aldo store passage), the image I 
               used for ankle booties is actually an ankle boot. The difference is that ankle boots end an inch to four 
               inches above the ankle, whereas ankle booties end right at the angle. I was actually pretty frustrated. I 
               literally could not find anywhere a free image of an ankle bootie! It was driving me insane when I decided I 
               just use an ankle boot image and make a disclaimer. I still wish there had been an actual ankle bootie image 
               available for free!!</p>
            <p>Also I made a note in my game and at the beginning of this post that the game is only about women’s shoes. 
               Unfortunately that was because two of the four points about shoes and personality are particularly about 
               women’s shoes (points 1 & 3). I decided to just stick with that and have them all be women’s shoes as I didn’t 
               want the game to get too messy using men’s shoes as well. If I had more points relating to men’s shoes I could 
               have made a more expansive game.</p>
	          <p>All in all, I really like my game and I hope you like it too! Twine is awesome and I would definitely like to 
               make more games using it in future!</p>
 
            

              
            <!-- <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>
